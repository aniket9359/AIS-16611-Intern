Task 1-Dictionary
Explaination-In Python, dictionaries are mutable data structures that allow you to store key-value pairs. Dictionary can be created using the dict() constructor or curly braces' {}'. Once you have created a dictionary, you can add, remove, or update elements using the methods dict. update(), dict. pop(), and dict,and then we can seen some examples.

Task 1-Tuple
Explaination-Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable,and then we see some examples pf tuples.

Task 1-Set
Explaination-A Set in Python programming is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set,then we seen some examples of set.

Task1-OPerators-
Explaination-In Python, operators are special symbols, combinations of symbols, or keywords that designate some type of computation. You can combine objects and operators to build expressions that perform the actual computation. So, operators are the building blocks of expressions, which you can use to manipulate your data,and then we sen some examples.

Task 1-Variable Decleration-
Explaination-A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number

Task 1-String
Explaination-In Python, strings are used for representing textual data. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (“”). The Python language provides various built-in methods and functionalities to work with strings efficiently.

Task 1-List
Explaination-A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ] .

Task 1-Numbers-
Explaination-Numbers in Python refer to the numeric data types in Python programming. Python supports three kinds of numeric data types: int, float, and complex. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use numbers in Python programming. We'll use Jupyter Notebook to implement the code.

Task 2- if statment-
Explaination-An if statement is a condition statement used to check a condition, and execute it if the condition holds true. 
It is also a control flow statement, which utilizes decision-making to control the flow of execution
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

Task 2- if elif statment
Explaination-We can use the if-elif-else statement to tell Python to try a different condition if the previous conditions were not met.
if… elif…else are conditional statements used in Python that help you to automatically execute different code based on a particular condition.
This tutorial explains each statement in this Python construct, along with examples.
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Task 2- if else statment
Explaination-The if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition. 
If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed.
Condition checking and if-else statements are vital parts of programming because they control the flow of execution . 
The if-else statement in Python enables decision-making in code. 
It determines whether to execute a block of statements based on the result of a condition check

Task2-for loop
Explaination-A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method
as found in other object-orientated programming languages.   
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.

Task 2-While loop-
Explaination-With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
A while loop is a control flow statement which repeatedly executes a block of code until the condition is satisfied. 
It stops executing the block only if the condition fails. 
One should use a 'while' loop when one needs to perform a repeated operation, but doesn't know in advance how many iterations would be needed.

Task 3-Break Statment-
Explaination-In Python, the break statement is used to immediately exit a loop when a certain condition is met. 
#When working with nested loops, the break statement can be used to break out of both the inner and outer loops.

Task 3- continue Statment-
Explaination- The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only.

Task 3-Pass statment-
Explaination-
The “pass” statement is a placeholder in Python code that signifies that a particular code block is empty or yet to be written. 
It is used to suppress errors and prevent unexpected behavior,and it is often employed in functions, classes, loops, and conditional statements.

Task 3-Statistical user defined funtion-
Explaination-In this Task we defined various statistical function like mean,mode,median,etc.first import the library statistics.

Task 3-logical drfined functions-
Explaintion-Python logical operators are used to combine conditional statements, allowing you to perform operations based on multiple conditions. These Python operators, alongside arithmetic operators, are special symbols used to carry out computations on values and variables.

 Task 4-NumPy Libarary
Explaination-
NumPy is a python library.NumPy is used for working with arrays.NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".

Task 5-Pandas Library-Series
Explaination:Pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.).
#A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.
